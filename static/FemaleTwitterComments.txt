I wish you all a fruitful Lenten journey and I ask you to pray for me and my collaborators as we begin our week of Spiritual Exercises
Only those able to acknowledge their mistakes and ask pardon receive understanding and forgiveness from others
The message of Jesus is troubling and disturbs us because it challenges worldly religious power and stirs consciences
In our daily lives we experience the tenderness of God who lovingly saves us from our sins fears and anxieties
When we confess our sins with humility and sincerity we receive forgiveness and are reunited with God and our brothers and sisters
We need the Holy Spirit to transmit the faith We cannot do it alone
I feel deep pain for the many children torn from their families and forced to become child soldiers This is a tragedy
To serve human life is to serve God and life at every stage from the womb of the mother to the suffering and sickness of old age
May the sick always be shown love in their fragility and respected in their inviolable dignity
The Lord is present in our lives showing us all His love and encouraging us to respond with generosity
Christians are called to keep alive the memory of how much God has done through them
We cannot remain silent before the suffering of millions of people whose dignity has been wounded
Let us welcome victims of human trafficking and all those fleeing from war and hunger with a compassionate heart
As we grow in our spiritual lives we realize how Grace comes to us and to others and must be shared with everyone
All of us are called to commit ourselves to protecting minors in the digital world
One who is aware of his own wretchedness and lowers his gaze with humility feels God s merciful gaze set upon him
Jesus wants to be found by those who look for Him But to look for Him we have to get up and go out
A life of faith means wanting to be with the Lord and that means constantly searching for Him wherever He is
May every person come to Christ the Light of Truth and may the world advance along the path of justice and peace
A faith that does not trouble us is a troubled faith A faith that does not make us grow is a faith that needs to grow
Jesus is our mediator who reconciles us not only with the Father but also with each other
Goodness together with love justice and solidarity are not achieved once and for all they have to be realized each day
Through prayer we can enter into a stable relationship with God the source of true joy
I pray for those who suffer from Hansen s Disease and I encourage those who are committed to their care and reintegration into society
Here we are Lord ashamed of what humanity made in your image and likeness is capable of doing Remember us in your mercy
Christian joy cannot be bought It comes from faith and from meeting Jesus Christ who is the reason for our happiness
Prayer allows us to see one another the way God our Father sees us and to realize that we are brothers and sisters
I would like to invite everyone to promote a journalism of peace a journalism created by people for people
The most radical antidote to the virus of falsehood is purification by the truth
There is no such thing as harmless disinformation trusting in falsehood can have dire consequences
Prayer that purifies strengthens and illuminates our path is like fuel for our journey towards full Christian unity
I am grateful to all who have accompanied me on my pilgrimage to Chile and Peru in so many ways especially with prayer
The Lord calls you today to travel with Him through the city your city He calls you to be His missionary disciple
Don t waste time hiding your heart Fill your life with the Holy Spirit
There is no better medicine to heal so many wounds than a heart capable of mercy
Praise to you Lord for this wonderful creation that is the Amazon people and for all the biodiversity these lands contain
Every life counts from the beginning to the end from conception to natural death
The Gospel message is a source of joy a joy that spreads from generation to generation and which we inherit
Listening to religious teaching or learning a doctrine is not enough What we want is to live as Jesus lived
We pray to God for the courage to ask forgiveness and to learn how to listen to what he is saying to us
I ask you to accompany me on my journey to Chile and Peru in your prayers
We should work to accommodate to protect to promote and to integrate whoever is forced to leave their own home an
We must not wait to be perfect before responding to the Lord who calls us but rather open our hearts to His voice
The encounter with God and our brothers and sisters cannot wait just because we are slow or lazy We are called to that encounter today
If we fail to suffer with those who suffer even those of different religions languages or cultures we need to question our own humanity
