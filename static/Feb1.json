Bitcoin is also broken in many ways, namely with Segwit, block size, high transfer fees and long confirmation times and no real solution is imminent. Perhaps right now people are jumping on BTC because it is the most recognizable crypto and the oldest, but how long will it take for people to see that it is essentially useless in its current state and just a store of value because people think it has value? \n\nOther cryptos have real world application like Stellar and Cardano.

{"body":"I feel like at the moment i'm the situation you were at back in august. I started out as an ETH miner in july and when the price of ETH gradualy increased I started looking to trade with crypto and was then casually investing since september every week or two (though with much less money than you) mostly making good daily trading where I managed to make 10-40$ per day. \n\nNow since I only had about 1000$ of crypto and 80% of it on bitfinex for trading I was happy with these gains. I also had this strategy to have all the money on bitfinex on fiat. I'd buy some coins like ETH or EOS and sell for a profit and then have all that money in fiat when I wasn't online: meaning I protected myself totaly from any \"overnight\" losses. And I've never been at a loss since then my net crypto worth was always higher than what I invested in from the bank.\n\nIn November I started learning more about different altcoins with great potential and investing new money into coins on other exchanges, diversifying my portfolio.\n\nAt the end of november I made a gamble and put 70% of my crypto money in IOTA at 0.88$ which then went to 5$. Thanks to all the shill posts here! xD Though in the middle of that rise I lost 30% of the IOTA because I sold it at like 1.7$ when bitcoin had a bit of a crash and then rebought in the morning at 2.2$. I still made x4 profits though. After it hit the peak I tried to retrade to get more IOTA untill i finally jumped the gun a few days ago, sold all IOTA at 4.6 and went to buy QASH which was at a very low 0.60$.\n\nThis was a good call and I managed to make 1500$ in two days. I was online when QASH went from 0.6 to 0.8 two days ago and managed to sell and rebuy at lower price, getting over 1000 more QASH than I had :D I also did this today though at much lower scale now having 200 more QASH than before.\n\nIn the meantime this week most of the altcoins I bought like REQ VEN ADA XRB have all doubled in price and i'm at an all time high of 5k$ pure profit 300% up from initial investments. And other coins like ETH, VTC, WTC, SUB, NEO have also gone up at least 20%. There's only one coin that I've made a loss with and that's QSP lol but that's a low key investment and the coin could easily double or triple when devs make more progress.\n\nJust as I was writting this post the QASH took a horrifying plunge: http://prntscr.com/hnujqg\nin which I would have lost 700$.\n\nBut I've learned to HODL by now else you get doomed by the HUD and FOMO and QASH has nicely recovered http://prntscr.com/hnuruc\n\nI have a very low paying job and have made like 70% of my yearly salary in just like 3 weeks of crypto trading and I'm just like you at your peak in august starting to make plans to quit my job (Though i'm also having another side project i'm coding in my spare time which I plan to make something out of www.reactorblock.com )\n\nThough I've came to a conclusion that if I don't double my crypto money by mid janury and cash out to cover my initial investments then it's not worthy of quitting my job just yet. If QASH's world book release doubles or triples QASH value then i'm certainly quitting my job and i'll cash out enough to get my initial investments plus a few months salary worth of money.

{"body":"Reality is the market cap as a whole reached over 600 billions and was heading toward a trillion dollars in no time. Even today its over 400 billions. Be honest, which one of these coins/companies is actually generating  the value of its marketcap? The answer is none. Doesn't mean it wont in the future but for now its not. I lost a lot money since yesterday because i was trading shitty coins which made me a lot of money before, truth is this should be a reality check for people so they put their money in real projects that they believe in and don't care if their price fluctuates. I still think the market cap is extremely high at 422B, these companies are not generating half of that money, if its pure accounting this market cap should be less than 100B. Take Cardano for an example (nothing against it, could be the biggest company in the world in the future) reached 14B in MC, that's bigger than the NFL+MLB combined with no actual product yet, do you really think that this is reality? Hell no. Also lets be real here, there is a lot of money being laundered here, take Tron for an example, they are pushing people to trade as much as possible in order to be able to win a Maserati, who the fuck does that? they reached a 4 billion cap space with no actual product, this is complete insanity.

{"body":"Not a shill, I hold maybe $50 in ARK right now, but I really like the idea behind it, especially in context of fucking Cryptokitties. If one app (*a fucking Neopets clone*) on the blockchain can slow Ethereum down this much.. it's shaken my faith in Ethereum as a long-term investment, because the demands on the network are only going to increase from here, and if this keeps up, Ethereum's actual utility will be fairly limited compared to some of the newer offerings, and that can severely limit it's growth moving forward.\n\nAs I understand it (and feel free to correct me here), ARK was designed to have a sort of central blockchain for the currency itself, so that way transactions can carry on unimpeded, while smart contracts are executed on side chains that branch off from it, all while still being able to draw on the core blockchain's resources somehow... it kind of loses me here. But the upshot of this is that the core blockchain retains its primary utility while still finding a productive use for the excess processing power it has at its disposal.\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that the current crop of dominant cryptos do not appear to be designed with future growth in mind, and the only way to modify them in response to growth is by forking, which, as we have seen with Bitcoin, is a pretty damn contentious issue, and creates a lot of confusion and uncertainty as to which blockchain is the most ideal to use (Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash?), or which is the real successor (Ether or Ether Classic?). I think that while Bitcoin definitely sets the standard for what a cryptocurrency should look like, it definitely isn't the best implementation of blockchain technology, and as a first-generation tool, that is entirely acceptable. I suspect that Bitcoin will stick around for a long time. But with a second-generation crypto like Ethereum, I'm less convinced, and I'm increasingly of the opinion that ARK or another third-generation crypto like it will eventually overtake Ethereum for purely technological reasons.\n\nThere are other cryptos I'm interested in, such as Cardano, which seems to have a very solid academic foundation and an unusual dedication to detail for a new cryptocurrency (again, correct me if I'm wrong here). That, plus Cardano has the explicit goal of developing their currency to suit regulatory regimes in an entirely *optional* capacity, such as by encrypting indentifying information within the transaction itself, something that would be very attractive to large financial institutions as a replacement for outdated ACH systems. And it's doing all of this with an eye to implementing smart contracts within its wallet in the near future, basically rolling the functions of several existing coins into one.  *And* it's also designing its wallet to be user friendly, something that remains a major barrier to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies by the general public. ***And*** that wallet application can be optionally set to contribute to the block generation process, and actually earn currency for the holder- literally building a miner into the wallet, effectively guaranteeing a large base of processing power it can draw from and incentivizing ADA holders to contribute. The more I read about ADA, the better I feel about sitting on it for a long time, because it feels very underappreciated.\n\nSorry for the long shill, I didn't mean to make it this long, but hopefully this gives you some clue as to why these are being hyped on this sub.","created_utc":"1512603817","score":"1"}

A lot of the benefits target regular users, but remember... as a regular user, when you convert from crypto to usd and vice versa, you do that with companies and enterprises. So a lot of the technology is meant to help those enterprises. \n\nThink about it this way: at some point, there will be some form of regulation. Ada is awesome because there is a paper trail built in, but the paper trail is anonymous unless you opt into it. What that means is, is if you wanted USD from a bank, you could send them ADA and they'd have the requisite information they needed for their records. But if you wanted to give someone ADA for weed or something, it's entirely anonymous.\n\nThe big thing is the built in upgrades, and they have a very nice decentralized plan for that. The thing is, is technology will always get better... Bitcoin has design decisions that needed to be improved on. Because of that, you get all of these forks, and you essentially can't improve on a lot of the formula. Cardano changes the game for that also.\n\nOh did I mention that they're working on a debit card for Cardano, so you can pay for your stuff at stores with Cardano and they handle the USD transaction for you?\n\nSo to wrap it up. As far as I know, this is the most technologically advanced bitcoin, that's built for thousands of transactions a second, that has a better way of generating new ada rather than having people waste electricity mining them, it has interoperability with other currency, it can be compliant if you want to deal with banks (especially if regulation is passed sometime next year), it has an upgrade system in place, it's built by very smart researchers and scientists, it's peer reviewed and there are whiteboard explaining the philosophy, and they're going to come out with a debit card that's going to change the game completely.\n\nIgnoring the \"invest and make money\" strategy that most people seem to be on, if you had to put money in the most practical, future forward, secure crypto, this is the one. And I think just by those merits, we'll see incredible growth of it in 2018, as cryptocurrency moves more in the public eye, and especially when they release that debit card!\n\nhttps://www.cardanohub.org/en/shop-with-cardano/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja9D0kpksxw","created_utc":"1512269698","score":"1"}

Anything is possible, but don't expect something like ADA (I only pick this because I see it has high mrkt cap and low coin value) to go to 10 dollars a coin, unless something changes drastically. \n\n2) There are financial analysis tools to aid in day to day trading, but at the end of the day, each coin is supposed to be valued according to it's perceived underlying value. i.e. the market thinks bitcoin is worth \u20ac237bn right now.

{"body":"Hello\n\nI just came across this thread to find more hints about investment in general.\nI've been into crypto currencies since August, which is actually a short time.\n\nAs I tried to find one to invest a short ammount to begin with, the one that I chose was XRP by Ripple. As I thought the Ripple technology could really change the way banks transfer money and this is why I got into it.\n\nI was already afraid when BTC was around 4000 dollars. This fast growth and interest reminds me of 1929 crack. So I wanted to go to newer projects as, the way I look at Bitcoin, it's not a coin that can be used to make transactions. Specially if we think it in a way that blockchain might change the way we pay and buy stuff someday.\n\nHowever, there is another project where I had plans to invest on, not because of the technology itself, but the super team behind it. And this one is Cardano, using it's coin ADA. Apparently, after I did, many Youtubers started to publish videos on the Internet about it.\n\nHowever I didn't want to split my investment on Ripple, so when Ripple took off a week ago I put some on ADA when it already raised fast so I didn't get it at the value I wanted to buy it although currently it has doubled the value since I invested. But I am seriously concerned what will happen when the team publishes news in a few days\n\nYes, I might have made money, but might have not made value yet compared to BTC or Ethereum as many people mention it.\nFor example, in the last month, BTC raised up like 4 or 5 times since August. So indeed, the best move would have been letting BTC rise and then buy Ripple or ADA and would have 4 or 5 times the quantity I have, adding a lot of value.\n\nHowever, how can you be so confident, specially for a newbie that wants to learn and tries to bet for \"technology that has potential\".\nIf you analyze Google Trends for example, and look for the term \"buy bitcoin\", you will see a huge interest in the last months, even a bit after August which is when I started. I believe it will fall sometime soon. And I would like to jump into BTC when everyone gets scared and \"hates Bitcoin\" because of what they lost.\n\nThis is why I bet for coins that have value in fiat as well, those that can be bought on places using fiat money, like XRP for example. For ADA, there's no exchange which allows this yet, and it's unlikely we get to see one soon.\nBut I suspect that XRP might be added to Coinbase in maybe weeks or months.\n\nOf course I do watch Youtube videos when they talk about certain coin and try to look at the project, what it does, etc. And of course it's confusing even if I am tech guy, but have no background on finances except a small stock course I took on my own prior getting into cryptos.\n\nRather than looking if I did well on investing on these 2 projects (which I would appreciate too), I would prefer to learn how you guys think and resources to learn. as many of you might be experienced investors\n\nAfter all, we all probably are here to maximize our gains, but at the same time to invest on projects we believe are worth in short, medium or long term. It's also difficult to not let a bit of greed go through I think\n\nThere is also the trading route using those pump and dump coins or even on GDAX (which I would love to learn as well), but that's not investing. But it might be a quick way to raise up money that you can use later to invest in those technologies you believe are worth it\n\nThanks","created_utc":"1513612171","score":"1"}

{"body":"&gt; With all do respect, you're missing what's happening in the example given. If I borrow a bitcoin today and buy a car worth 11k dollars for it, in one year when Bitcoin is up 300%, I need 33k dollars to pay back the loan. The car didn't rise 300% in value, but my loan did.\n\nThat's not how that will work. The value of Bitcoin for the next couple of years will be directly based on the fiat people are willing to spend for it. So for loans it makes more sense to pay whatever the value of the bitcoin is based on, that being fiat. Think about it this way: whenever you buy items with bitcoin, you have to pay less bitcoin if the value of it goes up.... there can never be a situation where someone prices something at .1 btc and they just leave it at that price. Same situation here: you would end up paying less bitcoin if the value goes up. I know you're going to make some \"that's not how it works\" but if bitcoin loans ever came to fruition, that would be how they needed to work, point blank. You can't just go \"ok this house costs 16btc\" and not fluctuate the bitcoin you charge based on the speculative price... it's really that simple.\n\nAs to your last sentence... again, I don't know the future. What I am saying, is bare minimum no country can just put out a blind copy cat and surge past ADA... it just doesn't make sense. Anything beyond that... who knows.\n\nI will say this. Very soon, Cardano is releasing a debit card. When you talk about cryptocurrency, you're really talking about practicality (the current btc isn't practical anymore). Other crypto's aren't going to be able to do this in the near future, if at all. I think that signals insane growth and potential.

That's debatable but even if we head there, it'll be the more general and global crypto that maintains the bulk of the value, and then people will convert to country specific crypto when they need to but it's not going to be where they hold most of their assets. If you're the rest of the world other than Sweden (especially governments)... do you want to buy another countries crypto, or would you rather place faith in a more general one, so as to not give another country an inordinate amount of power for no reason?\n\nLastly... don't underestimate the communities fervency towards moving away from banks. As a long term strategy for the community in general (ignoring investment, just looking at the practicality of crypto itself) it makes absolutely no sense to be tied to banks and corporations as far as crypto goes... none whatsoever. So you're positioning affiliation with Sweden (banks and or government) as a selling point but I think it's potentially a weakness... and if we start seeing in the news banks or governments becoming more hostile towards crypto, I think even if those country specific cryptos start gaining mindshare, their value will tank based on the actions of other governments and banks.","created_utc":"1512319486","score":"1"}

See if some coin drops small for a period of time, e.g. ada at 13-&gt;9 cents and buy in this period. wait for the boost and sell. invest this money for a period of time in another coin. when you saw the coin drop for a period of time and think it could rise soon -&gt; buy and hodl until pumps again.\n\nGood and stable coins dump only to ~80% of the peak, normal coins have this ~50% ratio.  \n\nSo buy coins with a big community that has a history of pump and dumps and buy when it had long time no pump and is about 60% of the pump.

Now you have incurred an opportunity cost of $50. If you had just left your money in ETH you could have made $200 instead of just $150. \n\nAlso, in this same scenario, your ADA is now worth less per ETH than it used to be!

{"body":"&gt; People mining or trading btc at .11c were for the most part buying it for use as a currency.\n\nThat's loaded. No one bought bitcoin hoping it would stay at .11c. The plan was always for the price to increase... so speculation is built in, you're incredibly and utterly wrong. The long term game was for bitcoin to be used instead of fiat, and bitcoin definitely does not deserve a .11c value if that ever comes to fruition.\n\nSo all we're talking about at the end of the day is speculation, as even when Bitcoin was .11c, it's not like it was practical to use. There weren't any big exchanges, most people didn't know what it was, it was easier to mine than to buy, outside of coders and a lot of geeky companies like domain hosting and dedicated server companies, and they'd give you like a 10% off discount if you paid with bitcoin, that was IT. So no bitcoin is only here because of speculation... you can't create some divide where there is none.\n\n&gt; Sure, you can throw a bunch of mud at a few alt coins that are just actually vapor ware with supposed great teams in blockchain (an industry that hasn\u2019t really been around all that long) and hope some sticks, sure\n\nAgain.

{"body":"Thanks for the clarification. First of all, I would ask where the valuation of *any* crypto comes from. Coins like ADA and EOS for example have no real functionality currently but are valued in the billions. Yet people see a perceived use-case and thus value them highly. So I'm not expecting to fully justify the valuation of XRP, but this is why I think it is a good investment.\n\nXRP is a working coin that anyone can use. It has a working desktop wallet that can legitimately clear a transaction in seconds. That in itself gives utility and value in today's market.\n\n&gt;Banks can send millions of dollars over the Ripple network without actually owning millions of dollars of XRP\n\nThis isn't true, the banks will purchase XRP and send it to another bank, which may choose to sell it and convert it to its fiat currency of choice. They may choose to use XRP because it's faster and safer than traditional methods because it clears right away. Another huge advantage comes from replacing nostro accounts. If you're a bank dealing in foreign transactions, then you probably have [nostro accounts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nostroaccount.asp) in all the foreign countries you deal with to hold foreign currency to facilitate your trade. You can imagine that nostro accounts in Japan, UK, Germany, Brazil, India, etc all add up to a lot of work to manage. You need to make sure you have appropriate funds in each account at all times, meet account minimums, etc.\n\nInstead, a bank can simply hold a pool of XRP to facilitate their trades. Now they benefit from much lower transaction fees, less errors, faster transactions, better liquidity, and less capital tied up in nostro accounts.\n\n&gt; if you don\u2019t NEED it to actually utilize Ripples transaction network\n\nWhile this is true, Ripple will save you money alone, but using Ripple with XRP, your savings will be even greater due to the advantages listed above. Ripple is first trying to get banks on to their network, and then give them the choice of saving even more money and time by utilizing XRP. Ripple estimates 33% cost savings with Ripple alone, or 42% if using XRP as well. https://ripple.com/files/xrp_cost_model_paper.pdf\n\nA final point because you seem to think the valuation of Ripple doesn't make sense - lets say there are only 1,000 XRP in circulation valued at $1 each, spread out amongst many players in an exchange. I want to send $1500 to someone, but have no XRP. So I start buying XRP from the exchange - can I only get $1000 worth of XRP?\n\nNo, as I start to buy the demand sharply rises as does the price. Let's say I ended up with 500 XRP now worth $3 and I complete my transaction. Now the market cap of XRP is $3000.  The recipient of my 500 XRP saw the sharp spike in demand and decides to only sell half of their XRP immediately, because they want to hold some for a future transaction.\n\nNow let's say XRP is quickly becoming more popular, and immediately someone wants to send $5,000 worth of XRP. The price **must** rise again in order to facilitate this transaction. It's basics of the free market.\n\nI believe this is what will happen as banks adopt XRP for international transfers. Currently trillions of dollars move across borders every year, a number I'm sure is growing.","created_utc":"1513311121","score":"3"}

{"body":"1. This is very difficult to explain, since different crypto currencies have different approaches to tackle the same problem: How can you be sure that the (money) transaction that you got from a stranger is legit and not just some data trash? You could say (most) crypto currencies are trying to build a decentralized transfer system for money that does not rely on any bank. You need to read up and understand what a \"block chain\" is. Right now, crypto currencies are using two methods of validation: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Both have advantages and disadvantages. Read up on them.  \n\n2. First: never invest in any crypto currency that you didn't read up on and don't listen to the shills in this sub. They will literally try to sell you a shitcoin as the best thing in the world. ( shitcoin = worthless crypto currency with no potential). Invest only in cryptos that you believe in. \nThat being said: BTC, ETH, LTC, ARK, IOTA, POWR, XMR. These are the ones that I like. Cardano is my favourite though (please don't buy that now. It will most likely drop in the next week. It's overvalued now). There are a lot of people that like NEO and OMG. I personally cannot understand that, but you should anyway read up on all of those coins and only *afterwards* invest in them. **Stay diversified !**\n\n3. There are already some use cases of crypto right now, but most of the time you just trade them against each other or hold them (HODL in professional language. yes, HODL). IOTA and POWR have some very interesting use cases that go beyond just using them as currency. Obviously, the currencies try to be established in as many use cases as they can. You need to decide which coin will be useful (or maybe is already very useful).\n\n4. Depends on your country of origin. Usually, you can buy ETH or BTC with money (real money, FIAT) on some exchange. You can then transfer them to a crypto exchange and trade there against your favourite crypto. If you don't want to daytrade, please hold the currency in a wallet, because the exchanges can get hacked.\n\nI'm from Europe and buy my BTC or ETH on bitcoin.de . For crypto exchanges, I really like **binance**. There is also coinbase, bitfinex, bittrex, gdax. Please read up on the exchanges and move your assets only after being verified on the exchange that you chose.  \n\nEDIT: Once you have a basic understanding on how things work, you can hit me up for some discussions.

{"body":"What you are looking at in ICX is a current top 20 coin with a 2.17 billion market cap.  In the future ICX should easily become like Cardano and become a top 6 coin which currently means a market cap between 10-17 billion.  IE: 500%-800% growth opportunity.  Price per a Token at that point would be: $25-$40\n\nREQ on the other hand isn't a core tech/protocol like ICX so in the short and long term it wont reach the heights ICX will but on the flip side it price is currently a lot lower.  Request is currently #88 on Coin Market Cap at 195 million or so.  The best non-core tech/protocol shows up up around the top 25 with a 1.7 billion cap.  So somewhere between a 500% -1000% growth opportunity. IE: $1.50 to $3 range.\n\nAll of this assumes that the market doesn't grow though, so I would actually bet on them increasing even more than I predicted.  January/February is going to be an interesting time frame for crypto, so many projects are actually releasing their first working products so they should start mooning again but at the same time due to the holidays a lot of people don't have any money to spare.","created_utc":"1514309643","score":"3"}

You can like him or hate him (and it seems people are very split on that), but it'd be absurd to say that someone who helped in bringing the Ethereum project to life, knows little about cryptocurrencies. Unless you meant long time cryptography experts, because they have people who literally have their masters in cryptography (and the teams they've worked with, [plus their research papers are available online](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sxdob7UAAAAJ&amp;hl=en)) and the teams at IOHK put their papers up for peer review with a [couple already accepted so far](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amycastor/2017/08/23/at-crypto-2017-blockchain-presentations-focus-on-proofs-not-concepts/#4a34b8117b70) (and this approach makes sense since the research was done in [collaboration](http://www.businessinsider.com/iohk-sponsors-blockchain-research-lab-at-the-university-of-edinburgh-tokyo-tech-2017-2?r=UK&amp;IR=T) with two [universities](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english/news/2017/037573.html). Saying they don't have crypto experts is quite the opposite of everything about this project, because their papers are about proving their implementation of proof of stake picks up the slack where others are vulnerable to attack. And you don't do peer reviews on a vague concept, which is most cryptocurrencies offer, these are actual proofs submitted to conferences related to cryptography and security.\n\nAnyways, I can understand the issue when it comes to their looks since some industries put a lot of value on looks and presentation. Seeing people from various walks of life in the tech industry is something I've gotten used to, where some people look young enough to be fresh out of highschool, some dress poorly and wear ragged/baggy clothes, and some are old enough to have retired a while ago (actually someone I worked with used to be a doctor for quite a long while before they left that profession and dived into their passion which was coding). Defcon is absolutely great at that kind of thing, cause you see security experts from all over, and age and looks can be very misleading in regards to what they know and the position they hold (professionally). But, I fully understand where you're coming from with the concern that they might look young or like 'used car salesman'.\n\nEither way, I just hope you didn't miss out on investing in Ethereum because of how Vitalik looked/dressed/acted, because I know that he looks pretty damn young and doesn't always dress in the [most professional manner](https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/vitalik-buterin-147a2578.jpg), but he's still great at what he does.\n\nEdit: Grammar.","created_utc":"1513807747","score":"4"}

This would've been topic of the year few years back when everyone cared about consensus security.\n\nqtum pos coin has 49% in control of the original company (yikes) + 51% distributed via ico (yikes) [afaik](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/78pluv/why_isnt_there_more_enthusiasm_about_qtum/dow38x8/). they plan to fix nothing at stake by tethering hashes into bitcoin chain, which I'm curious how they will secure &amp; verify.\n\nneo validation is currently not great but they plan to let others become miners next year - I guess. but you can already predict what I'll critisize - pos coin where  50-60% is in hands of devs (yikes) with ico model for other 40% (yikes) [afaik](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/78z73o/why_arent_there_more_projects_building_on_neo/doy8tj7/)\n\ntbh I haven't seen much need for eth-like smart contracts with so little mentioned &amp; significantly downplay about bitcoin-like smart contracts can do (just using btc as an example) which doesn't count as platform for w/e reason sometimes but provides more security. I keep asking myself about every eth project whether we need something like evm for it, and I don't think I've ever seen a usecase that requires it that another coin can't do better.\n\nI'm trying to think of some evm like platforms. Maybe ubiq, I think it was distributed fairly with 0 premine 0 ico, but I could be confusing names bc I don't have or follow it.\n\nno idea what happened with expanse initial 10m coin premine that's supposed to go into a dao. \n\nWe're waiting for 2x to be over with to get rsk finally live (most painful part about 2x is this delay). I have issues with rsk due to the centralized fee they take on drivechain bridge, although fast arbitrage cross chain swaps wouldn't be included in those per drivechain design. ~1:1 peg helps distribution problem.\n\nPersonally, I'm looking for non-evm designs which would be fun to learn and see what they enable, but I don't want to speculate very far term.\n\nIs Cardano any good? I still haven't read properly about it, just few annoying videos advertising academics (lol why)\n\nlisk sidechain design is something unique I suppose, but I need to read into it again since ico, more to see how its security model handles this fragmentation. distribution was 100m total, 1% early supporters, 2% close ppl, 4% campaigns, 8% core, 85% ico. so about 15% in close circle and 85% ico'ed - not a fan of standard ICO distribution but far better than the 50% premines above.

NEO will be used for all asset based functionality and contracts - I confirmed this in person in NYC with NEO and Fosun (no volume is being lost from the meat of what NEO was built for).  In fact my guess is that this will take off non profitable system instructions and reserve bandwidth for much higher GAS charge asset based transactions and contracts to fill up the entirety of the 10,000 TPS pipeline.\n\nThere was also a lot of FUD about NEO being centralized which is technically true right now but will not be true in about 3 months or so.  People will still say its centralized because of 10 nodes or whatever.  No matter how many times critics say that, its still not going to be true as ~10 nodes is decentralized regardless if it suits their preferences about how many nodes there should be.  NEO has a node voting process where the middle 50% of NEO holders can vote in and out bookkeepers/nodes.  Thats the system - its high performance, its less nodes, it still decentralized, it leaves holders in charge, just going to have to take it or leave it.  \n\nDa said they will give more guidance with an announcement in about a month on NEO and its plan forward.  I think this will give people more confidence and less confusion.  The back end development despite confusion has been phenomenal over the past few months and looks great moving forward.

{"body":"There isn't a coin that solves the problem of being a decentralized and scalable platform.  Not one coin.  Look at bitcoin, with under 3 million users, it struggles and fees are $40.  What about Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin?  With under 1 million users their fees are $2 already.  By 30 million, they'll be $60 or more.\n\nHow will any of the platforms allow 30 million users?  Or 100 million users?  There are 7 billion people, most of whom earn less than $1 per day.  How will they use a platform that costs multiple days wages?\n\nYou'll see bad solutions that people laud as great successes.\n\nLightning?  It costs two transactions to open a channel, that's $80.  And your channel is meant to be timed so it auto-closes in like 10 days.  The only people that helps are exchanges who constantly have transactions between cold storage and hot and to other exchanges and to users' wallets.  It does zero for users who want to send one transaction a month.  Why would they pay for 2 transactions to create a 10-day channel when they only send 1 per month?  And $80 per 10 days?  If we eliminate 50% of transactions, which is generously optimistic, and fees drop to $10, it's still $20 per 10 day channel.  Lightning is garbage.  It only helps exchanges and zero users will use it unless they're day traders or affluent enough not to care about burning $20 per 10 days, or $60 per month for lightning.  What about a lightning channel that lasts 100-days instead of 10?  Uh, your bitcoins are locked, that means you effectively have zero bitcoins for that duration and are forced to use lightning, and you have very little security on lightning and lack of decentralization.  You might as well sell bitcoins if you're just locking it for 100 days or more.  But you don't want to fomo and miss out on price rises?  Then you wouldn't use lightning either because you wouldn't spend coins if you fomo it will go up massively.  In either case, you want to spend it, or you don't want to spend it, lightning is useless.  All locked layer-2 solutions are, they require 2 transactions just to set up (2x fees), make your main-chain coins useless for that lock time interval, even if you decide not to spend it on anything.  It will reduce spam traffic between exchanges, but that's it.\n\nTangle aka DAGs?  You'll see iota pitching that they've solved the decentralized and scalable problem.  Yes, it's far more scalable than blockchain design, but it's not decentralized.  I'm not even talking about the Coordinator, imagine they shut that crap off and everyone acts honestly and no one is 33% attacking it.  (Yes, DAGs are 33%-attackable instead of 51%-attackable for blockchains).  The problem with free transactions is that their database grows super large and very quickly.  Every few weeks the IOTA foundation takes a Snapshot of the database, and releases a new genesis block with balances for everyone from the last snapshot.  Uhh, what?  Iota foundation determines your balance every few weeks?  Don't believe me? They have a claims process for you to open a ticket with them if they got your balance wrong.  They say it's unlikely, but can happen if you made a transaction around the time they generated the snapshot.  Uhh, what??  This garbage is valued over $10 billion?  If IOTA Foundation runs away or gets hacked, everyone is screwed.  If govts lean on IOTA Foundation to set certain accounts to $0 balance, then protesters and whistleblowers are screwed.  Iota cannot function as a crypto currency unless the database is periodically deleted and everyone accepts a new genesis block every few weeks.  Stinks.\n\nIf you're asking for investing advice, I can't tell you the future.   These turds can rise up another 1,000% because people fomo like crazy.\n\nBut if you're asking for product advice, I can tell you with 100% certainty that every product out there right now is either unusable by more than a few million users circle-jerking each other, or is a centralized payment network no better than PayPal but with a worse user interface and tokens instead of real money.  (Imagine if PayPal required you to purchase PayPal tokens and send them around? Oh, and you might lose 90% of its value.  Even PayPal isn't that stupid.).\n\nBetween the two, at least the 1 million circle-jerk is decentralized and can't go to $0.  But what is the value of 1 million people using coins?  It can't be spent, either because you'll fomo that it'll keep going up, or because there's no where to spend it since the platform can't support more than a few million users and fees are through the roof as a result.  That means the only way to get value is to sell it when you're done fomo'ing or done hodl'ing and get fiat.  But if everyone sells for fiat, the price will come crashing.  \"Oh, no, new users will enter as old users leave!\"  You realize the old users cashing out $250k or more entered with only $1,000 or less?  The only reason this musical chairs is working is because many of the new users are rich wall st types with $250k to buy in.  Once they smell the stink and exit, the only new users left are teenagers who were wearing diapers in 2009.  They're lucky if they have $1,000 to enter.  Uh oh, a platform that can only support a few million users and then new users only have $1,000 or less?  10 million users times $1,000 is $10 billion.  That means even if bitcoin grows from 2 million users to 10 million users, it can't have more than $10 billion AUM once the old rich users cash out and the new users are holding the bag.  Either the new users need to mortgage their house and *each* enter with $250k, or a scalable solution needs to be found where 250 million users can use the platform with fees under 2 cents.\n\nThat awesome product capable of supporting 250 million users with under 2 cent fees, while being decentralized, is worth $250 billion or more.  There is huge demand for a working crypto product.  But that product doesn't exist yet, and somehow the lackluster product we have now is being valued as though it were that messiah.\n\nI'm optimistic that an innovative solution will come out from this.  So many people are finally thinking about these problems, someone will solve it.  Will it be someone on the Bitcoin team?  Ethereum team?  Iota team?  Cardano team?  Or an entirely new team?  Will it be patented or open?  Next year or five years from now?  Who knows.  But the future is bright for users.  May not be so bright for investors.\n\nTl;dr:  no decentralized coin platform supports more than 2 million users; and at $1,000 per user, no platform today can reach over $2 billion AUM if it weren't for circle-jerking where these 1 million users say money is a shared delusion and their $1,000 they entered with is \"obviously\" now worth $250,000.","created_utc":"1514155207","score":"8"}

He decided to go to Japan in the wake of regulatory issues due to their adoption of Cryptos as currency. Also he began working with an organization called Emurgo based in Japan with the goal of finding investors. This is why the ICO was done in Japan and it was not behind closed doors. They had everything publicly available but clearly they are new and haven't grown off of hype alone. \n\nRegulation is obviously a huge issue at the moment and government's are going to be bringing down these ICO's(Tezos, bitconnect). This will flush out the system and leave a few standing. Cardano has an continues to follow regulations and a reason they haven't made big waves in the U.S. is because of regulatory issues. This is one of the worst countries to start a project because there are 50 states who want to tax and recognize blockchain as different property. \n\nThe price of Cardano and supply is very attractive to new comers. Let's say it grew 100 times by tomorrow, it would only be $2.50. You would have made $250,000 if you invest $2,500 today. For those new investees $2.50 still feels reasonable to buy in and sets it apart from the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum. At $8000 and $300 alot of young investors( the majority crypto owners) couldn't hold more than 1-2 BTC or 20 ETH. The psychology plays out in a way that is fantastic for early adopters.\n\nIOHK has contracted a large team that is split on different aspects of the Cardano Foundation to build upon and improve it's infrastructure until 2020. They also have the Daedalus wallet which will be universal and allow direct purchase of crypto. You will stake off of this wallet by keeping it open to verify transactions and you will be provided a reward for confirmations. \n\nStarting in 2018 staking will begin and they will have 25 ATMs available in Japan. They already have and ADA debit card and paper wallets ready to go. Emurgo will be bringing in dapp developers to build into the project which as a staker you will be able to vote on those projects. \n\nCardano will never be hard forked because of its layers it can be soft forked for updates. It will have interoperability, scalability, and a treasury system. \n\nI hope this was useful and I highly recommend researching on your own. You will find more details that I left out. This isn't trying to kill NEO or Ethereum, its just trying to be the best blockchain available.

But XRB has risks in that its software hasn't been thoroughly reviewed yet and there may be other non-code-related unforeseeable problems that are a deal-breaker. However, if it does work out, I see this as having an even higher room for growth than REQ despite being higher in marketcap. REQ is a ECR20 token whereas XRB is a protocol coin that would make BTC,BCH,LTC all obsolete. But despite IOTA being designed for MTM payments, once the IOTA ecosystem becomes mature and robust, I can see it also being used for PTP payments and that might cut into XRB's niche.\n\nREQ: Self-explanatory. \n\nIOTA: The next big thing imo. A 2017 ETH-like bullrun is in the cards with this one. Why? Look at the world around you. Our world is increasingly being automated and whether you like it or not, today's tech researchers and VCs have chosen to place their bets on AI/IoT/Machine Learning out of the plethora of other things they could bet on. As such, development in this space is not only inevitable, for better or worse, but creates a need for a M2M microtransaction system that, to this date, only IOTA provides. Realize this: there are over a 1000 cryptocoins yet many of these coins have use-cases that overlap with each other so they are competing for a slice of the same niche-pie (example would be ETH vs ADA vs NEO). The future IoT market is estimated to be around 19 Trillion dollars. That estimation could be wrong of course but imagine if IOTA captures just 1/19th of that (which is so unrealistically low but anyways....). That's still $347/mIOTA. And crypto has a strong track record of blowing away ultra-conservative estimates. Investing in IOTA depends on how much you think the IoT market is going to grow. Initially, I was skeptical because I didn't see why the fuck people needed to buy a fridge that's connected to the internet and whatnot. I don't like things being techy for the sake of being techy, like the Apple watch. There needs to be a true functional use that a certain tech is satisfying. Then I realized the industrial and commercial uses of MtM interactions (and the subsequent need for MtM microtransactions) and discovered this doesn't have to be something everyday ordinary citizens have to even be consciously knowledgeable about to be set up to use. The average joe won't be needing to buying iota off exchanges, setting up and securing a wallet, etc. in order to participate in the IOTA network. The average joe will be purchasing devices (such as a electric car) that already have MtM microtransaction payment settlement systems embedded in them to automatically interact with other recognizable devices out in the world and the average joe could simply pay the bills via other, more traditional means if that's what they're comfortable with. IOTA is high risk, high reward. Either it moons the fuck out to over a trillion marketcap or it goes to nothing. \n\nXMR: Let's be honest: XMR is the coin we envisioned when we first heard of bitcoin. Remember when you mentioned bitcoin to folks years ago? What'd they all say? Either they didn't know or they'd be like \"isn't that the thing drug dealers used, sounds shady.\" Then as time went on, we realized bitcoin is hardly anonymous. IRS is running advanced blockchain tracking tech using Israeli contractors as of now; if you're ever ran your coins through Coinbase/GDAX, you've been targeted. But bitcoin maximilists claim that CTs and mimblewimble will make bitcoin truly anonymous, which is just not true. True privacy can only be achieved at the protocol level. CTs will only obscure the amounts sent between people, not from who to who. And you think Blockstream, a co that's had years to find a scaling solution and is still epic failing, will be able to come to a consensus on making BTC truly fungible? Lol no fucking way, esp when they're a for-profit co. There's a reason darknet dealers moved away from BTC ages ago and are using XMR. The market for a truly private coin in which to park assets is worth many many trillions. Just see the recent panama/paradise papers to realize just how many filthy trillions is stashed abroad legally. I'm sure there are much more like that stashed illegally. Sadly, XMR has less room for growth in 2018 alone than a coin like REQ or XRB b/c a lot of people have been realizing this coin's potential in the latter part of this year. But XMR is still one of the top-10 coins that still has a tremendous amount of room to grow and it's downside is considerably lower than XRB, REQ, IOTA.
